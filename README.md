# Simple-Marquee-iOS
This is a Swift3 implementation of a Marquee with using the table view cell based approach which is commonly found.

Why do you need the marquee UI effect?
Its commonly found in a lot of iOS applications and the most common example is the iOS 10 audio player app. Observe the album name marque on a locked screen as well as when you play a song.

In this implememtation I have used to UI objects. A dummy label which is a UIlabel used to create the marquee scrolling effect and a gradient layer which is used to provide the burring effect.

Here is a sneek peek to the marquee effect.
